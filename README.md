  ## Description

  ## Usage
  
  Must have Node.js installed, and understand how to use node, terminal, and a code editor. To use this project, first make sure you are familiar with node, CLIs, and terminals, and also first have the express node module installed (command script above). To initiate the app, start with "node server.js". This creates a backend server hosted from your local device, through which you can access the app by entering 'http://localhost:3001/notes' into your browser url header (port# can be edited). From there, you will be able to create and manage your own personal list of notes. The server will run continuously until exited in the CLI, which you can do by pressing 'ctrl + c' or 'cmd + c'.
